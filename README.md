# inbox-collab
inbox-collab allows organizing and collaborating on emails that are sent to multiple people at once.
It solves the common problem in clubs where you never know who read and possibly responded to an email.

Mails from multiple configurable mail servers are collected
and based on reply headers and other metrics they are sorted into [matrix](https://matrix.org/) threads.
Boilerplate metadata, such as giant footers commonly found in emails, is stripped using a large language model.
